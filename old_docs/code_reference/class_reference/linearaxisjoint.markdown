 `Component` `Physics`



(NOTE) Legacy. A linear axis joint is used to keep an object locked on a plane that is defined by a normal. This was made to help make a dynamic character controller. Instead of locking translation along a plane, the constraint can be turned off with a motor attached to it which will drive movement in the direction of the plane normal. This can then be thought of as a "move in direction" constraint.
