How to customize an exported game.


## Custom Game Icon


To give your exported game a custom icon:

 - Create a .ico file using a tool or website. 
  - Example: http://converticon.com/
 - Place in the same directory as your project file (Command "ShowProjectFolder") 
 - Set the name Name to: "Icon.ico"

Export your game and your new icon will replace the default.
