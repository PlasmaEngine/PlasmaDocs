The [ AddNoiseNode ](https://github.com/PlasmaEngine/PlasmaDocs/blob/master/code_reference/class_reference/addnoisenode.markdown) collects audio data from all of its inputs and adds white noise (with a low pass filter) to the audio before passing it along to its outputs.

 # Common Uses

- Simulating effects such as a crackling speaker

 # Using the AddNoiseNode

The AddNoiseNode inserts noise into the audio using both addition and multiplication; the additive noise will sound similar to having a separate white noise generator playing, while the multiplicative noise alters the audio directly. The combination can mimic what you might hear from something like an old-fashioned radio speaker.
