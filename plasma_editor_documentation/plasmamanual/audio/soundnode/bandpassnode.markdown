The [ BandPassNode ](https://github.com/PlasmaEngine/PlasmaDocs/blob/master/code_reference/class_reference/bandpassnode.markdown) collects audio data from all of its inputs and applies a band pass filter to it before passing it along to its outputs. 

 # Using the BandPassNode

Band pass filters are a combination of low pass and high pass filtering which allows only a select band of frequencies through. The `CentralFrequency` property sets the frequency at which the band is centered, while the width of the band is controlled by the `QualityFactor` property.
