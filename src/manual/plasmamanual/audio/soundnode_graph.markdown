The SoundNode Graph tool displays the connections between all SoundNodes that are currently attached to the output of a SoundSpace. The nodes are color-coded and labeled according to their type. Orange lines connecting nodes indicate a connection which is currently producing audio, while gray lines indicate connections with no audio.
