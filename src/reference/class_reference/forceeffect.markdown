 `Component` `Physics`



(NOTE) A force effect that is applied in a given direction (local or world space). This is used to create force regions that will push objects in a given direction. This can also be used on a rigid body to push an object in it's forward direction (e.g a missile) if applied locally. Note: this is always applied at the center of mass of the object. If a more rocket like effect is desired see ThrustEffect.
