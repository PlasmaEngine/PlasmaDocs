The [ ModulationNode ](https://github.com/PlasmaEngine/PlasmaDocs/blob/master/code_reference/class_reference/modulationnode.markdown) collects audio data from all of its inputs and applies either amplitude or ring modulation to the audio before passing it along to its outputs. 

 # Common Uses

- Using amplitude modulation to regularly vary the volume of a sound
- Using ring modulation to create sound effects or synthesizers

 # Using the ModulationNode

Amplitude modulation will oscillate the volume of the audio at a rate set by the `Frequency` property. The volume changes from `0` to `1.0`. If the user does not want the volume to go to silence, setting the `WetPercent` to values below `100` will reduce the strength of the modulation.

Ring modulation will directly alter the frequencies of the sound, with stronger effects as the `Frequency` value gets larger.
