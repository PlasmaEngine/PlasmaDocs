The [ ChorusNode ](https://github.com/PlasmaEngine/PlasmaDocs/blob/master/code_reference/class_reference/chorusnode.markdown) collects audio data from all of its inputs and applies a chorus filter before passing it along to its outputs. 

 # Common Uses

- Combining with other audio filters to create sound effects or environmental effects

 # Using the ChorusNode

Chorus filters use an oscillating delay filter to add a chorus-like effect to the audio. The `ModulationFrequency` property controls the speed of the oscillation, while the `MinDelayMillisec` and `MaxDelayMillisec` properties set the delay values that the filter oscillates between.
