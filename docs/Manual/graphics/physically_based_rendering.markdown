Physically-based rendering (PBR) is a relatively recent rendering technique and workflow that aims to better represent how the surface of objects appear as they do in real life. This is primarily achieved by taking a more nuanced approach to how light interacts with different types of surfaces, metals and non-metals in particular. If you are unfamiliar with PBR, check out one of the following links regarding basic theory, asset creation, or the actual physics and math behind the calculations.

 # Implementation in Plasma

The [DeferredRenderer and ForwardRenderer](https://plasmaengine.github.io/PlasmaDocs/Manual/plasmamanual/graphics/renderer/deferred_renderer.markdown) follow a metallic-roughness workflow (as opposed to metallic-glossiness) and expects inputs for albedo (referred to as "base color" in other workflows), metallic, roughness, and specular in the form of texture maps or uniform values. These maps or values are set via LightningFragments and applied to a [Material](https://plasmaengine.github.io/PlasmaDocs/Manual/plasmamanual/graphics/materials/materials_overview.markdown).
