# Editor

The editor is created once and manages:

- All windows and docking (done through the base MultiDock class)
- The current level(s) being edited
- All running game sessions
- Selection
- Operation queue (undo/redo)
- Commands
- Tools

Commands
----
- Requires documentation

Commands from Data
---
Commands are loaded from the Data\Commands.data file in the Plasma repository. These commands are then bound in C++ to specific functions on the editor.

Cog Commands
---
CogCommands are just Cogs that are marked as a command object, and when the command is invoked, the 'ExecuteEvent' event will be sent on the cog. This allows for users to create custom commands without learning a new system. They use what they're used to and just respond to a different event. The command Cogs are all created in a single Space (named "CommandSpace") that lives under the editors game session.

There are two ways a CogCommand can be created:

- A Component with the [Command] attribute with the attribute parameter 'autoCommand' set to true.
- An Archetype with tag "Command".

Command Context
---
This gives commands more information about the circumstances they were invoked in, such as which viewport has focus when the command is invoked.

Command 'Active' state
---
Used for Tools and toggle-able commands. Example: Tools have Commands that enable them, so when the tool is selected, that command is now considered 'Active' until another tool is selected. This allows the IconButton in the Ui to display that the tool is active.
