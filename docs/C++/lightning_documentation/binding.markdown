# Binding

For convenience, all of the Lightning C++ code is compacted into one header and one cpp.

WARNING: Lightning uses its own containers, including Array, HashMap, String, etc. For compatibility with STL, the containers support `.begin()` and `.end()` iterators, as well as `.size()`. The String class supports `.c_str()`.

 #  Compiling C++

Include the Lightning.cpp into your compilation process, and start by having your main include the Lightning.hpp

```lang=csharp

# include "Lightning.hpp"


using namespace Lightning;

int main()
{
  return 0;
}
```
So long as Lightning.cpp is built and linked in, this program should fully compile.

 #  Compiling a Lightning script
```lang=csharp

# include "Lightning.hpp"


using namespace Lightning;

int main()
{
  // Any one time startup and static initialization Lightning needs to do
  // This also registers a custom assertion handler (Lightning code has many user friendly asserts!)
  LightningSetup setup(StartupFlags::None);

  // A project contains all of the code we combine together to make a single Lightning library
  // The project also sends events for compilation errors that occur (includes friendly messages / error codes)
  Project project;

  // Here, we can register our own callback for when compilation errors occur
  // The default callback prints the file, line/character number, and message to stderr
  EventConnect(&project, Events::CompilationError, DefaultErrorCallback);

  // Add some test Lightning code that does NOT compile, just to try it out!
  // The second parameter provides a name for when compilation errors come up, in this case 'MyCode'
  project.AddCodeFromString("class Foozle++", "MyCode");

  // Create a list of dependent libraries, in our case we're really not adding anything to this
  // A side note: the Core library in Lightning is always added as a dependency, because Core includes
  // things like Integer, Boolean, Real, the basic vector types, String, etc
  Module dependencies;

  // Compile all the code we added together into a single library named "Game"
  // We already know this is going to fail to compile, so the error callback
  // we provided above should get called
  project.Compile("Game", dependencies, EvaluationMode::Project);

  return 0;
}
```

 #  Running a Lightning script
As a language meant to be called and run from C++, Lightning has no 'main entrypoint' of its own. Instead it is up to the user to instantiate types defined witLightningilch scripts and call functions on them (or invoke static methods).

Create a Lightning script with code that we want to test out.

 ##  Player.Lightning

```lang=csharp
class Player
{
  var Health : Real = 100;

  [Static]
  function SayHello()
  {
    Console.WriteLine("Hello world!");
  }

  function TakeDamage(amount : Real)
  {
    this.Health -= amount;
    Console.WriteLine("Ouch! I've got `this.Health` health left!");
  }
}
```

From the C++ side change `AddCodeFromString` to `AddCodeFromFile`.

`project.AddCodeFromFile("Player.lightning");`

WARNING: Make sure to put the `Player.lightning` file side by side with the executable, or make sure that the working directory is setup correctly so that the executable can find the script file.

We now need to compile the code into a Library, and finally link that library into an ExecutableState. A Library stores all the compiled types and functions. The ExecutableState has its own stack and virtual machine, and is responsible for executing Lightning code.

```lang=csharp

# include "Lightning.hpp"


using namespace Lightning;

int main()
{
  // Any one time startup and static initialization Lightning needs to do
  // This also registers a custom assertion handler (Lightning code has many user friendly asserts!)
  LightningSetup setup(StartupFlags::None);

  // A project contains all of the code we combine together to make a single Lightning library
  // The project also sends events for all compilation errors that occur (which includes friendly messages and error codes)
  Project project;

  // Here, we can register our own callback for when compilation errors occur
  // The default callback prints the file, line/character number, and message to stderr
  EventConnect(&project, Events::CompilationError, DefaultErrorCallback);

  // Load the Lightning code for our Player class from disk (make sure the working directory is setup properly)
  project.AddCodeFromFile("Player.lightning");

  // Create a list of dependent libraries, in our case we're really not adding anything to this

  // Be careful! If the code fails to compile, this function will return null

  ErrorIf(library == nullptr, "Failed to compiler library");

  // We want to link together all the libraries that we depended upon, along with our own library

  EventConnect(&Console::Events, Events::ConsoleRead, DefaultReadText);

  // The call object uses its constructor to initialize a stack frame in
