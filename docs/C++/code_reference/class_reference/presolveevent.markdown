 `Event` `Physics`



(NOTE) Event sent out when a CollisionFilter contains a PreSolveBlock. This event is sent out after collision detection but before collision resolution. This can be used to alter the state of the two objects in a collision before they're resolved (e.g. turn one from static to dynamic). Warning: Do not delete objects or do any other significant changes as this may destabilize the system.
