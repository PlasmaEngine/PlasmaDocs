# PhysicsCasting

One of the most common run-time interactions with a [PhysicsSpace](https://plasmaengine.github.io/PlasmaDocs/Plasma1/Editor/physics/physicsspace.markdown) is casting, which queries for all objects within a region of space. This allows common operations such as line-of-sight queries, volume queries, and so on.

Typically a cast will take 3 arguments:
  - The shape to cast
  - How many results to receive at max. This is needed for internal optimizations in physics. For Ray/Segments, the results will be sorted by the t-value.
  - The [CastFilter](https://github.com/PlasmaEngine/PlasmaDocs/tree/master/docs/C%2B%2B/code_reference/class_reference/castfilter.markdown) describes how to filter out results when casting. Common operations include skipping objects of certain configurations (Static, Kinematic, [CollisionGroups](https://plasmaengine.github.io/PlasmaDocs/Plasma1/Editor/physics/collisionoverview/collisiongroupsandtables.markdown), etc...).
  
Currently, the physics systems supports a few common casting types:

## Ray Casting

[ray](https://github.com/PlasmaEngine/PlasmaDocs/tree/master/docs/C%2B%2B/code_reference/class_reference/ray.markdown) casting checks for all shapes in a direction. Ray casts are common for things like line-of-sight tests.

## Segment Casting

A [segment](https://github.com/PlasmaEngine/PlasmaDocs/tree/master/docs/C%2B%2B/code_reference/class_reference/segment.markdown) cast is like a ray cast except it has an end position. Segment casts are used when there is a known max distance for the cast.

## Sphere Casting

[sphere](https://github.com/PlasmaEngine/PlasmaDocs/tree/master/docs/C%2B%2B/code_reference/class_reference/sphere.markdown) casting checks to see what objects are within a sphere. Useful for simple volume queries such as finding all objects within an explosion radius.

## Aabb Casting

[aabb](https://github.com/PlasmaEngine/PlasmaDocs/tree/master/docs/C%2B%2B/code_reference/class_reference/aabb.markdown) casting checks what objects are within an axis-aligned box. Sometimes a box is a better shape for casting, especially when the query area is long an thin.

## Frustum Casting

[frustum](https://github.com/PlasmaEngine/PlasmaDocs/tree/master/docs/C%2B%2B/code_reference/class_reference/frustum.markdown) casting checks what objects are within a frustum. Useful for queries that come from a camera where perspective should be taken into account.

## Collider Casting

Sometimes a more complicated shape query is desired. [Collider](https://github.com/PlasmaEngine/PlasmaDocs/tree/master/docs/C%2B%2B/code_reference/class_reference/collider.markdown) casting allows the user to say: "What if this collider was over there". This is commonly used for a simple preventative collision check.

## CastFirst

Ray and Segments have an additional "CastFirst" operation for convenience. These cast functions implicitly have a max object count of `1`.
  
# DispatchWithin

In addition to regular casting, the [physicsspace.markdown](https://plasmaengine.github.io/PlasmaDocs/Plasma1/Editor/physics/physicsspace.markdown) contains other common cast related functions. Sometimes casts are performed just to send events to all shapes within a region. This is common for a generic interaction system where each object may or may-not handle some event. Instead of casting and iterating over all results, the PhysicsSpace has the "DispatchWithin" functions. Currently only Sphere and Aabb dispatch functions exist.

# Sweeping

While a cast can be used as a preventative check, sometimes the accuracy is not enough. This is where the `SweepCollider` function comes in. Sweeping can be thought of as extending a collider's volume in a direction to find the exact times that a collision would happen with static objects. This allows writing Time-of-Impact logic to avoid missing any collisions.

NOTE: Swept casts are expensive operations and should be used only when important, such as a player.
