# Cylinder Collider

[CylinderCollider](https://plasmaengine.github.io/PlasmaDocs/Plasma1/C++/code_reference/class_reference/cylindercollider.markdown) defines a [cylindrical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cylinder ) shape for collision. The base size of the cylinder is determined by the Radius  and Height  properties. Scale is applied afterwards to determine the final cylinder's size.

(NOTE) **Recommended Reading:** The [Collider](https://plasmaengine.github.io/PlasmaDocs/Plasma1/Editor/physics/colliders.markdown) page should be read before this page.

## Radius
Radius  defines the radius of the cylinder in local space.

## Height
Height  defines the total local space height of the cylinder. The height is defined as the distance from the bottom disc to the top disc.

## Direction
The Direction enum property is used to configure which local-space axis the height of the cylinder runs along. This allows aligning a cylinder with an asset that was configured about a different axis.

## Non-Uniform Scale
When non-uniform scale is applied, the CylinderCollider will always stay a perfect cylinder. The height of the cylinder will fully respect the object's scale, but the radius will come from the larger of the two remaining scale values.
