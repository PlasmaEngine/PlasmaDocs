# Roughness
Roughness quite simply defines how rough--or conversely, how smooth--a particular material is. The greater the roughness of a surface, the greater the diffusion of light that hit that surface. Roughness can be defined either by value, which is uniformly applied across the surface of a [Material](https://plasmaengine.github.io/PlasmaDocs/Plasma1/Editor/graphics/materials/materials_overview.md), or by texture map, which defines the roughness value for each discrete part of the Material.

Roughness as defined in the [deferred renderer](https://plasmaengine.github.io/PlasmaDocs/Plasma1/Editor/graphics/renderer/deferred_renderer.md) follow microfacet theory, in which surface irregularities on the Material cause reflected light to "blur". The higher the Roughness value, the greater the blurring effect will be. For a quick look at how increasing roughness corresponds to increased blur, the following screenshot shows spheres with constant albedo and metallic , but an increasing value of roughness from 0 to 1:

Especially through the first five or six spheres, as the roughness goes up, the reflection gets progressively more pronounced until individual objects reflected from the skybox are no longer visible.

# The Roughness Fragment

Roughness may be set using a value or a texture map. If a value is used it is applied uniformly across the surface of the Material. If a texture map is used, the Roughness value may be set to different values ranging from 0 to 1 across the surface of the Material. 

## Roughness Value

When the RoughnessValue fragment is applied, the roughness value specified will be applied uniformly across the surface of the Material. To add a RoughnessValue fragment, click on the the `Add LightningFragment` button in the Material Properties window and select `RoughnessValue`, as seen below:

## Roughness Map

When the RoughnessMap fragment is applied, different roughness values are applied to discrete sections of the Material, as dictated by the texture map. To add a RoughnessMap MaterialBlock, click on the `Add MaterialBlock` button in the Material Properties window and select `RoughnessMap`, as seen below:

RoughnessMaps may be broken down into two broad categories: tileable roughness maps, which can be used on any model, and model-specific roughness maps, which are intended to be used with a specific model or set of models.
