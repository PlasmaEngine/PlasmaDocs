# Access the Add a Resource Window

The `Add a Resource` window is the interface by which all new Resources added. There are a number of ways, however, to access this window: through the Add Command and through a Resource Property in the Properties window window.

## Add Command

The Add command can be invoked in two different ways:

1. [ Command](https://plasmaengine.github.io/PlasmaDocs/Plasma1/Editor/editor/editorcommands/commands.markdown) : [ Add Resource](https://github.com/PlasmaEngine/PlasmaDocs/tree/master/docs/C%2B%2B/code_reference/command_reference.markdown#add)

2. In the Menu bar `Resource  > Add`

## Create Resource Through Properties

A Resource may be added by clicking on the `Create New Resource` button on any Property that has a Resource as its type:

# Add a Resource Window

Either of the methods illustrated above will result in the `Add a Resource` window, though at different states. As seen in the screenshot above,  using the `Create New Resource` button will access the interface for the same type of Resource as the the Property by which it is being opened (e.g., the Material Resource interface will be opened if creating a new Resource through a Material property).

When using the Add Command, however, the type of Resource desired must first be chosen:

- Select the resource type you wish to add
- Select the resource template you wish to use
- Choose a name for your resource
- Add any applicatable tags.
- Click the Create button button
