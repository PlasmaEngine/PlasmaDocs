Assets such as textures and models comprise the majority of the graphical content in a game. 2D assets take the form of sprites and spritesheets (i.e. sprite animations) while 3D assets take the form of models, model animations, and textures (which are 2D art assets, but commonly applied to 3D objects through a {link university}[Material](https://github.com/PlasmaEngine/PlasmaDocs/blob/master/plasma_editor_documentation/plasmamanual/graphics/materials/materials_overview.markdown)). The following pages discuss importing and the initial setup of these assets:
