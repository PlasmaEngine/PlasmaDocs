Some objects in Plasma model a concept as opposed to something actually has a physical representation in the scene. Objects like **GameSession**, **Space**, and **LevelSettings** are key to maintaining a flexible and efficient code base. They also provide access to settings that can makes changes on a game-wide, space-wide, and level-wide scale.
