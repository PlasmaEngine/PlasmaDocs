The Plasma Engine uses a component based architecture that makes it easy to extend both the functionality of your game and the editor. In this section you can find explanations of the concepts that are core to our overall philosophy when constructing the engine and projects within it.

If you feel you need more practice with architecture concepts check out the architecture tutorials section [here ](https://github.com/PlasmaEngine/PlasmaDocs/blob/master/plasma_editor_documentation/tutorials/architecture.markdown).


 #  [Cogs](https://github.com/PlasmaEngine/PlasmaDocs/blob/master/plasma_editor_documentation/plasmamanual/architecture/cogs.markdown)
Cog is a reverse acronym for Game Object Composition. In component based architecture game objects are simply a collection of components.

 #  [archetypes.markdown](https://github.com/PlasmaEngine/PlasmaDocs/blob/master/plasma_editor_documentation/plasmamanual/architecture/archetypes.markdown)
An Archetype Resource is the serialized definition of a Cog which can be used as a template from which to create new cogs from. 

 #  [Significant Objects](https://github.com/PlasmaEngine/PlasmaDocs/blob/master/plasma_editor_documentation/plasmamanual/architecture/objects.markdown)
The objects found in this section provide access to settings that can have an effect on a game-wide, space-wide, and level-wide scale. Every user should be aware of these objects and their respective properties.


 #  [Resources](https://github.com/PlasmaEngine/PlasmaDocs/blob/master/plasma_editor_documentation/plasmamanual/architecture/resources.markdown)
Resources are serialized pieces of data that fuel your game. There are many types of resources ranging from imported Textures to SoundCues generated in engine.

 #  [Components](https://github.com/PlasmaEngine/PlasmaDocs/blob/master/plasma_editor_documentation/plasmamanual/architecture/components.markdown)
